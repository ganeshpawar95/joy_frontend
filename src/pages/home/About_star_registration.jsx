                We only name stars that are clearly visible from any place on
                earth throughout the year! If you do not like the star we have
                named for you, or on the rare occasion that you're dissatisfied
                with our service, we will name another star for you or refund
                the full purchase price.

              <p>
                We have officially partnered with Star-Register.com, the
                worldwide leading Star Platform, which regularly audits us for
                quality, reliability and data safety. If you buy a star it gets
                recorded in the registry and, thus, can be retrieved at any time
                by using their unique iOS and Android App.
